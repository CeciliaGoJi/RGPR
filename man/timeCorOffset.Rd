\title{Constant-offset correction (time) of the GPR data}
\usage{
\S4method{timeCorOffset}{GPR}(x, t0 = NULL, c0 = 0.299)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A object of the class GPR}

\item{t0}{A numeric vector with length equal either to \code{NULL}, or one 
or to the number traces.
If \code{t0 = NULL} `time0(x)` will be used.}

\item{c0}{Propagation speed of the GPR wave through air (used only when
\code{keep = NULL}).}
}
\description{
Time correction for each trace to compensate the offset between transmitter 
and receiver antennae (it converts the trace time of the data acquired with
a bistatic antenna system into trace time data virtually acquiered with 
a monostatic system under the assumption of horizontally layered structure).
Note that this function does not change the trace but only the time (time
scale).
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{time0}} to set time zero and 
         \code{\link{firstBreakToTime0}} to convert the first wave break
         into time zero.
