\title{Direct-Current shift removal}
\usage{
\S4method{dcshift}{GPR}(x, u = NULL, FUN = mean)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of the class `GPR`.}

\item{u}{Number of time samples used to evaluate the DC-shift.}

\item{FUN}{A function to apply on the first `u` time samples (default is 
`mean`; alternatively `median` could be used or any user defined function).}
}
\description{
The direct-current shift is estimated for each traces based on a specified 
number of time samples (normally the samples before time-zero). Then, the
direct-current shift of every trace is substracted from every trace.
