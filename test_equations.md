### As it is

*A*<sub>*g*</sub>(*t*)=*A*(*t*)⋅exp(*α* ⋅ *t*)

### protected with `\`

$$ A\_g(t) = A(t)(t) $$

### protected with `<pre>`

<pre>
$$
A_g(t) = A(t)\cdot \exp(\alpha \cdot t)
$$

Inline equation
---------------

### As it is

This is a test *A*<sub>*g*</sub>(*t*)=*A*(*t*)⋅exp(*α* ⋅ *t*) with a nice equation.

### protected with `\`

This is a test $ A\_g(t) = A(t)(t)$ with a nice equation. With $ = 1$

### protected with `<pre>`

This is a test
<pre>$A_g(t) = A(t)\cdot \exp(\alpha \cdot t)$</pre>
with a nice equation.

### protected with `<span>` NOT WORKING!

This is a test <span>*A*<sub>*g*</sub>(*t*)=*A*(*t*)⋅exp(*α* ⋅ *t*)</span> with a nice equation.
