# RGPR

<p class="message">
  `RGPR` is a free and open-source [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) package to read, write, analyse and visualise <strong>ground-penetrating radar (GPR)</strong> data. `RGPR` is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) at [https://github.com/emanuelhuber/RGPR](https://github.com/emanuelhuber/RGPR). 
</p>

<p>This R-package is still in development, and therefore some of the functions may change in a near future. </p>

<p>To report bugs, contribute to the development of `RGPR`, see [how to contribute](https://github.com/emanuelhuber/RGPR/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)</p>

<p>If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, feel free to contact me (in english, french or german):<br/> emanuel.huber@alumni.ethz.ch</p>
